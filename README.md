Hosts configuration

**PATH**

If no host provided through the command line interface, `gputree` will look for a configuration file. By default, it looks for `gputree/config.yml` file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config`. You can set the path to the configuration file by setting the `$GPUTREE_CONFIG_FILE` environement variables.

```bash
export GPUTREE_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/gputree/config.yml`
```
